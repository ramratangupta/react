# Fiber vs. Concurrent Rendering: Side-by-Side Comparison

To understand the difference between Fiber and concurrent rendering, it's essential to recognize that Fiber is the architectural foundation that enables concurrent rendering. Here's a breakdown:

**React Fiber:**

* **What it is:**
    * React Fiber is a complete rewrite of React's core reconciliation algorithm. It's designed to improve the performance of React applications, especially when dealing with complex UIs.
    * It introduces a new data structure called the "Fiber tree," which represents the component tree.
    * A "Fiber" is a unit of work. It's a JavaScript object that holds information about a component.
* **Key purpose:**
    * To enable incremental rendering, allowing React to break down rendering work into smaller, manageable units.
    * To make rendering interruptible, so React can pause and resume rendering work as needed.
    * To improve responsiveness by prioritizing updates.
* **In essence:**
    * Fiber is the underlying architecture that makes concurrent rendering possible.

**Concurrent Rendering:**

* **What it is:**
    * Concurrent rendering is a feature that allows React to work on multiple rendering tasks at the same time without blocking the main thread.
    * This means that React can start rendering an update, pause it to handle a higher-priority update (like user input), and then resume the original rendering.
* **Key purpose:**
    * To improve the responsiveness of React applications, especially when dealing with complex UIs or slow devices.
    * To prevent the UI from freezing during long-running rendering tasks.
    * To enable features like "Suspense" and "Transitions."
* **In essence:**
    * Concurrent rendering is the capability that Fiber enables. It's the ability to perform rendering work concurrently.

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**

| Feature | Fiber | Concurrent Rendering |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Nature | Architectural change | Capability enabled by Fiber |
| Purpose | To enable incremental and interruptible rendering | To improve UI responsiveness through concurrent work |
| Function | Provides the underlying structure and mechanism | Describes the resulting behavior and benefits |
| Relation | Foundation | Result |

In simpler terms:

* Fiber is the engine.
* Concurrent rendering is how that engine allows the car to drive.

Therefore, you can't have concurrent rendering without the Fiber architecture.
